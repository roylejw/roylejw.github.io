    "text": "Having left industry after five years working in the R&D space in genomics and sequencing, I am now a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan, working within the Bennett Lab. I currently lead the metagenomic and bioinformatic components of Grassland Genomics for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation (GG4GHG), a Genome Canada–funded program that investigates how plant genetic and species diversity, together with soil microbial and insect communities, shapes carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation potential, and other ecosystem services in Canadian grasslands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch vision\nMy work is driven by a central question: how do plants, microbes, and viruses thrive in concert with one another, and how do these interactions shape biological function and environmental outcomes?\nI am particularly interested in the functional genetics of microbial life, where plant performance and broader ecosystem success is derived from microbial outputs, and microbial success is governed by the inputs of their surround communities. My focus is using functional genomics to understand how biological interactions are encoded, regulated, and expressed across interacting plant–microbe–virus systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nCore research areas\nMicrobial ecology. Investigation of microbial community dynamics and plant-soil interactions, in a range of environmental contexts to discern how the microbial community influences (and is influenced) by their interactions.\nViral ecology. Examination of viruses as integral components of the soil ecosystem, focusing on how viral infection, lifestyle, and host interactions influence microbial function, community dynamics, and cross-kingdom feedbacks in environmental systems.\nEpigenetics and functional regulation. How does epigenetics contribute to functional differentiation in host-associated and environmental systems, particularly in the context of plant–microbe interactions and environmental stresses.\n\n\n\nCurrent external collaborations\nCAT-G Genome Canada: Contributing genomic and integrative analyses to support cross-platform and cross-system synthesis within the Genome Canada ICT’s, funded through the CS-DCC.\n\n\nContact and links\n\nEmail: jack.royle@usask.ca\nGitHub: Here\nGoogle Scholar: Here\nLinkedIn: Here\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\nPublications and preprints: Publications\nCV: CV\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: 2026-01-02\n\n\n\nVisits"
