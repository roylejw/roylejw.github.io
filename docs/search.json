I currently lead the metagenomic and bioinformatic components of GGrassland Genomics for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation (GG4GHG), a Genome Canada–funded program that investigates how plant genetic and species diversity, together with soil microbial and insect communities, shapes carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation potential, and other ecosystem services in Canadian grasslands.\n\n\nMy research is driven by a central question: what do plants, microbes, and viruses do in concert with one another, and how do these interactions shape biological function and environmental outcomes?\nI am particularly interested in the functional genetics of microbial life in ecological contexts where they interact to influence plant performance and broader ecosystem processes.
