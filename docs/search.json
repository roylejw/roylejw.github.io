    "text": "I am a postdoctoral fellow in Plant Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. I currently lead the metagenomic and bioinformatic components of Grassland Genomics for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation (GG4GHG), a Genome Canada–funded program that investigates how plant genetic and species diversity, together with soil microbial and insect communities, shapes carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation potential, and other ecosystem services in Canadian grasslands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch vision\nMy research is driven by a central question: what do plants, microbes, and viruses do in concert with one another, and how do these interactions shape biological function and environmental outcomes?\nI am particularly interested in the functional genetics of microbial life in ecological contexts where they interact to influence plant performance and broader ecosystem processes. My focus is using functional genomics to understand how biological interactions are encoded, regulated, and expressed across interacting plant–microbe–virus systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nCore research areas\nMicrobial ecology. Investigation of bacterial and fungal community dynamics in soil and plant-associated environments through a range of molecular and bioinformatic practices.\nViral ecology. Examination of viruses as integral components of the soil ecosystem, focusing on how viral infection, lifestyle, and host interactions influence microbial function, community dynamics, and cross-kingdom feedbacks in environmental systems.\nEpigenetics and functional regulation. How does epigenetics contribute to functional differentiation in host-associated and environmental systems, particularly in the context of plant–microbe interactions and environmental stresses.\n\n\n\nCurrent external collaborations\nCAT-G Genome Canada: Contributing genomic and integrative analyses to support cross-platform and cross-system synthesis within the Genome Canada ICT’s, funded through the CS-DCC.\n\n\nContact and links\n\nEmail: jack.royle@usask.ca\nGitHub: Here\nGoogle Scholar: Here\nLinkedIn: Here\n\n\n\nQuick links\n\nPublications and preprints: Publications\nCV: CV\n\n\n\n\n\nLast updated: 2025-12-19"
